#### Visualize data with Excel
The bank is concerned as it is experiencing numerous customer departures. I was tasked with presenting a action plan to the marketing director of Primero Bank, to prevent further waves of customer attrition. Before establishing this action plan, it is crucial to understand why customers are leaving the bank. My role was to rely on data to explain these departures. Initially, I needed to analyze the data to:

Identify common characteristics among customers who have left.
- Deduce at least 5 analysis avenues regarding the reasons they left.
- Identify among current clients the profiles that might leave.
